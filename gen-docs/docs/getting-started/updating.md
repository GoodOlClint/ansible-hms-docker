# Updating

To easily update from this git repo _**and**_ update your custom variable names (due to deprecating/renaming variables) if you are on a previous release, run:

```bash
make update
```

Previous variable names will still work for at least a year after the change and will be noted as such within the default configs. Please update to resolve.

Please see the [Release Notes](../category/release-notes) if you are updating from a previous version.
